# Blocks you've always wanted

A small minecraft mod that just adds blocks.

Initial release:
* hanging signs showing an item. useful to mark shops or work areas. not craftable, made by using an item on a normal sign. can be waxed, preventing modification.
* fence-on-a-slab. needed for small curved bridges or some staircases. also not craftable, made by placing a fence on a slab. will drop both blocks separately.
* wide gate. a gate that you can actually go through while riding a horse or a chocobo. can stand above rails to nicely block off your tunnels. craftable.

Next release:
* likely paper doors and walls. we have paper walls (shogi) in quark mod (i used quark but not anymore), but without doors, those walls just annoyed me because i wanted to use them but i couldn't. craftable. no wood variants.
